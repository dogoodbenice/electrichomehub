# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Current Status
Electric Home Hub is now a pure static site with zero build dependencies. The previous build errors were caused by GitHub Actions looking for Node.js build processes that are no longer needed.

## Simple Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Direct GitHub Pages (Recommended)
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Navigate to Pages section
3. Source: Deploy from a branch
4. Branch: main
5. Folder: / (root)
6. Save settings

This bypasses GitHub Actions entirely and serves your static files directly.

### Option 2: Disable GitHub Actions
If build errors persist:
1. Go to repository Settings → Actions → General
2. Set "Actions permissions" to "Disable actions"
3. Use Option 1 above for deployment

## Files Ready for Deployment
- `index.html` - Homepage
- `api.html` - Developer API documentation
- `tracking.html` - Device tracking interface
- `documentation.html` - Document management
- `monitoring.html` - Issue monitoring dashboard
- `export.html` - Data export tools
- `faq.html` - FAQ page
- `css/styles.css` - Main stylesheet
- `js/*.js` - Interactive functionality
- `images/favicon.svg` - Site icon
- `.nojekyll` - Disables Jekyll processing
- `package-lock.json` - Minimal dependencies file

## Expected Results
After deployment, your site will be available at:
`https://dogoodbenice.github.io/electrichomehub/`

All navigation, interactive features, and API documentation will work without any build process.

## Troubleshooting
- If pages show 404: Ensure all HTML files are committed to main branch
- If styling is missing: Check that css/ and js/ directories are included
- If build still runs: Use Settings → Actions to disable automated builds

The static site is complete and ready for immediate deployment.
