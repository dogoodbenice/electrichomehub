# Electric Home Hub - Concept Overview

## Overview

Electric Home Hub is a full-stack web application designed to centralize smart home device management across all brands and platforms. The platform provides device tracking, documentation management, proactive issue monitoring, and developer APIs to simplify the fragmented experience of managing devices from multiple manufacturers.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with HTML5 for maximum compatibility
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS variables for theming (black background, white text, red #ff3333 accents)
- **Components**: Modular JavaScript functions with DOM manipulation
- **State Management**: Local state management with localStorage persistence
- **Build Tool**: No build process required - direct static file serving
- **Interactivity**: Native DOM events and modern JavaScript features

### Deployment Architecture
- **Static Hosting**: GitHub Pages with direct HTML/CSS/JS files
- **Data Strategy**: Client-side data management with demonstration datasets
- **File Structure**: Self-contained HTML pages with shared CSS and JavaScript modules
- **Example Data**: Comprehensive demonstration data showcasing all five core functionalities

### Backend Architecture (Development Mode)
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based session storage with connect-pg-simple
- **Development**: Hot reload with Vite middleware integration

### Project Structure
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express.js backend API
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript schemas and types
- `migrations/` - Database migration files

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses four main database tables:
- **devices**: Core device inventory with manufacturer, model, warranty, and location data
- **documents**: File storage references for manuals and documentation
- **alerts**: Proactive monitoring notifications with severity levels
- **apiKeys**: API key management for developer integrations

### API Layer
- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on all entities
- Type-safe request/response handling with Zod validation
- Error handling middleware with structured error responses
- Logging middleware for API request monitoring

### UI Components
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Comprehensive component library using Radix UI primitives
- Dark theme with brand red (#FF0000) accent color
- Form handling with react-hook-form and Zod validation

## Data Flow

### Development Mode
1. **Client Requests**: React components use TanStack Query to fetch data
2. **API Layer**: Express routes validate requests and interact with storage
3. **Database**: Drizzle ORM handles type-safe database operations
4. **Response**: JSON responses with proper error handling and status codes
5. **UI Updates**: Query cache invalidation triggers automatic UI updates

### Static Deployment (GitHub Pages)
1. **Environment Detection**: Query client detects GitHub Pages deployment
2. **Static JSON Files**: Data served from `/public/api/*.json` files
3. **Fallback System**: In-memory data as backup if JSON files unavailable
4. **Consistent Experience**: Same UI components work across both modes
5. **Demo Functionality**: All five core features fully demonstrated
